# Econometrics
The following repository provides a miscellaneous of econometrics codes in R, Julia, Matlab and Python written by me. I try to make the codes in each folder as much comparable as possible.


| Folder        | Object          
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Probit Model   | Monte-Carlo simulation of binary Probit estimator | 
| Logit Model    | Monte-Carlo simulation of binary Logit estimator    |  
| Ordered Probit Model    | Monte-Carlo simulation of Ordered Probit estimator (Two Thresholds)    |  
| BLP           | [BLP (1995)](https://www.google.com) method for estimating Mixed Logit model  |
